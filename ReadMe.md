# BSJ, QI   - Learning Management System

The Quality Institute (QI), the training and capacity-building arm of the Bureau of Standards Jamaica (BSJ), delivers a wide range of standards-related, quality management, and technical training programs to stakeholders across various sectors. Currently, many aspects of the training delivery process—including course registration, scheduling, participant management, evaluation, certification, and reporting are handled through manual or semi-manual methods. These processes are time-consuming, prone to errors, and limit the Institute’s ability to scale, automate, and deliver data-driven decision-making insights.

To improve efficiency, enhance the learner’s experience, and strengthen administrative control, the QI requires a modern, integrated Training Management System (TMS).
